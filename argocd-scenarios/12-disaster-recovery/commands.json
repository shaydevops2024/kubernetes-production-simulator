      "description": "Deploy the application with auto-sync and self-healing enabled",
      "explanation": "This Application has automated sync with selfHeal:true and prune:true. This means ArgoCD will automatically restore any deleted or modified resources to match the Git state. This is the foundation of GitOps disaster recovery.",
      "what_it_does": "Creates the ArgoCD Application with full auto-sync capabilities.",

      "description": "Verify all resources are deployed and healthy",
      "explanation": "You should see 3 running pods, a service, a configmap, and the application showing Healthy/Synced. This is our baseline 'good state' stored in Git.",

      "description": "Simulate accidental deletion of the deployment",
      "explanation": "Someone accidentally ran 'kubectl delete deployment' in production. All pods are immediately terminated. Without GitOps, this would require finding and re-applying the correct manifests manually.",

      "description": "Watch ArgoCD automatically restore the deleted deployment",
      "explanation": "Because selfHeal is enabled, ArgoCD detects the drift (deployment missing from cluster but present in Git) and automatically re-creates it. Within seconds, the deployment and pods are restored. No manual intervention needed!",

      "description": "Confirm application is fully recovered",
      "explanation": "The application should be back to Healthy/Synced. All 3 pods are running again. ArgoCD restored everything from Git automatically. The recovery time depends on the sync interval (default: 3 minutes) or self-heal check.",

      "description": "Delete multiple resources simultaneously",
      "explanation": "This simulates a more severe incident where multiple resources are deleted. ArgoCD will detect all missing resources and restore them all in a single sync operation.",

      "description": "Verify ArgoCD restored both the service and configmap",
      "explanation": "ArgoCD restored both resources in a single sync. This demonstrates that GitOps provides a complete disaster recovery mechanism. As long as your Git repo is intact, your entire infrastructure can be rebuilt.",
