      "description": "Review the Application CR with automated sync policy",
      "explanation": "Notice the syncPolicy section with 'automated', 'prune: true', and 'selfHeal: true'. This means ArgoCD will automatically deploy changes from Git, remove resources not in Git, and revert manual changes.",
