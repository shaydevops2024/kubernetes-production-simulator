      "description": "Review all manifests to see their sync-wave annotations",
      "explanation": "Each manifest has an argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave annotation. Resources with lower wave numbers are synced first: ConfigMap (wave -1) -> Deployment (wave 0) -> Service (wave 1). This ensures the ConfigMap exists before the Deployment references it.",

      "description": "Review the PostSync hook Job manifest",
      "explanation": "This Job has argocd.argoproj.io/hook: PostSync annotation, meaning it runs AFTER all sync waves complete. The hook-delete-policy: HookSucceeded means the Job is deleted after successful completion. This is useful for running smoke tests or notifications after deployment.",

      "description": "Observe the ordered deployment in ArgoCD UI",
      "explanation": "In the ArgoCD UI resource tree, you can see the sync progressing through waves. Each wave must complete (resources become healthy) before the next wave begins. This ordering prevents issues like Deployments starting before their ConfigMaps exist.",

      "description": "Verify the PostSync hook job ran and completed",
      "explanation": "The PostSync Job runs after all sync waves complete. Because we set hook-delete-policy: HookSucceeded, the Job is automatically deleted after success. You may see it briefly, or it may already be cleaned up. The events can confirm it ran.",
