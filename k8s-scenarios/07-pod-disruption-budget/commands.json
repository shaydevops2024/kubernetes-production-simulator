      "description": "Deploy 3-replica app with PDB requiring minAvailable: 2",
      "explanation": "Creates deployment with 3 replicas and a PodDisruptionBudget ensuring at least 2 pods stay available during voluntary disruptions (like drain, eviction). PDB protects against unsafe operations that would violate availability.",
      "what_it_does": "Creates pdb-demo-app deployment (3 replicas) and pdb-demo PodDisruptionBudget (minAvailable: 2).",
