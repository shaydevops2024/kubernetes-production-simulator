      "command": "kubectl apply -f statefulset.yaml -n scenarios",
      "description": "Deploy StatefulSet with 3 replicas and PVCs",
      "explanation": "Creates headless service and StatefulSet. Each pod gets a stable name (nginx-sts-0, nginx-sts-1, nginx-sts-2) and its own PersistentVolumeClaim. Pods are created sequentially (ordered).",

      "description": "Monitor sequential pod startup",
      "explanation": "Pods create in order: nginx-sts-0 must be Running before nginx-sts-1 starts, and so on. This ordered startup is a StatefulSet guarantee. Press Ctrl+C when all 3 are Running.",
