# Node Failure Scenario

## Overview
Learn how Kubernetes handles node failures by simulating node drain and watching pod rescheduling.

## What You'll Learn
- Cordoning nodes (mark unschedulable)
- Draining nodes (evict pods)
- Automatic pod rescheduling
- Self-healing behavior

## Resources Created
- Deployment: node-failure-demo (3 replicas)
- Service: node-failure-service

## Cleanup
Run cleanup command to remove all resources.
