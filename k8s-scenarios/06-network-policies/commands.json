      "description": "Deploy backend app, service, and NetworkPolicy",
      "explanation": "Creates backend deployment with label 'role: api', a service to access it, and a NetworkPolicy that restricts access. Initially, without the policy, any pod can reach the backend. The NetworkPolicy will only allow pods with 'role: frontend' label.",

      "description": "See NetworkPolicy in YAML format",
      "explanation": "Shows the complete policy: podSelector targets app=backend, policyTypes: Ingress restricts incoming traffic, ingress allows from podSelector role=frontend. Default behavior is deny-all unless explicitly allowed.",
