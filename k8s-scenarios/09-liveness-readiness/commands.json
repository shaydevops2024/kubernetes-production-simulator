      "description": "Create scenarios namespace",
      "explanation": "Creates namespace for probe testing.",

      "command": "kubectl apply -f k8s-scenarios/09-liveness-readiness/deployment.yaml -f k8s-scenarios/09-liveness-readiness/service.yaml -n scenarios",
      "description": "Deploy deployment and service with liveness and readiness probes",
      "explanation": "Creates deployment and service with both probe types configured. Liveness probe checks /healthz every 3s after 3s delay. Readiness probe checks /healthz every 5s after 5s delay. This deployment uses k8s.gcr.io/liveness image which simulates probe failures.",
      "what_it_does": "Creates deployment 'probes-demo-app' and service 'probes-demo-service' with 2 replicas.",
      "next_step": "Check pods are running with probes active."

      "name": "Step 3: Verify Pods Running",
      "command": "kubectl get pods -n scenarios -l app=probes-demo",
      "description": "Check pod status",
      "explanation": "Should see 2 pods in Running state. Both probes must pass for pods to be Running and Ready.",
      "what_it_does": "Lists probes-demo pods.",

      "description": "See recent pod events including probe results",
      "explanation": "Look for 'Liveness probe failed' or 'Readiness probe failed' events. Initially all should be passing.",

      "command": "sleep 15 && kubectl get pods -n scenarios -l app=probes-demo",
      "description": "Wait for liveness image to automatically fail",
      "explanation": "The k8s.gcr.io/liveness image automatically starts returning HTTP 500 after 10 seconds. After 3 probe failures (failureThreshold: 3), Kubernetes will restart the containers. This sleep gives it time to fail and restart.",

      "command": "kubectl get pods -n scenarios -l app=probes-demo --watch",
      "description": "Monitor pod restarts from liveness failures",
      "explanation": "The containers will restart every ~40 seconds as they repeatedly fail health checks. You'll see RESTARTS count increment. Liveness failure triggers container restart (not pod deletion). Press Ctrl+C to stop watching.",
      "what_it_does": "Streams live pod status showing restarts.",
      "next_step": "Verify restart count increased."
    },

      "name": "Step 8: Check Restart Count",
      "command": "kubectl get pods -n scenarios -l app=probes-demo",
      "description": "Verify RESTARTS column increased",
      "explanation": "RESTARTS column shows how many times containers have been restarted. Should be 1 or more after liveness failure. This proves liveness probe auto-recovery.",
      "what_it_does": "Displays pod restart counts.",
      "next_step": "Test readiness probe separately."

      "name": "Step 9: Check Service Endpoints",
      "command": "kubectl get endpoints probes-demo-service -n scenarios",
      "description": "View service endpoint list",
      "explanation": "Shows which pod IPs are included in the service. Only Ready pods are listed. If a pod fails readiness, it's removed from here (but pod stays running).",
      "what_it_does": "Lists pod IPs receiving traffic from service.",
      "next_step": "Scenario complete! Probes protect service availability."
