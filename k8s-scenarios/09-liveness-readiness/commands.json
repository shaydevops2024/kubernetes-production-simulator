      "explanation": "Creates namespace for probe testing.",

      "command": "kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml -n scenarios",
      "description": "Deploy app with liveness and readiness probes",
      "explanation": "Creates deployment with both probe types configured. Liveness probe checks /healthz every 3s after 3s delay. Readiness probe checks /healthz every 5s after 5s delay. This deployment uses k8s.gcr.io/liveness image which simulates probe failures.",
      "what_it_does": "Creates deployment 'probes-demo' and service with 2 replicas.",
      "next_step": "Check pods are running with probes active."

      "description": "Check pod status",
      "explanation": "Should see 2 pods in Running state. Both probes must pass for pods to be Running and Ready.",

      "description": "See recent pod events including probe results",
      "explanation": "Look for 'Liveness probe failed' or 'Readiness probe failed' events. Initially all should be passing.",

      "command": "kubectl exec -n scenarios deployment/probes-demo -- rm /tmp/healthy",
      "description": "Remove health file to fail liveness probe",
      "explanation": "The liveness probe checks for /tmp/healthy file. Removing it causes the probe to fail. After 3 failures (failureThreshold: 3), Kubernetes restarts the container.",

      "description": "Monitor pod restart from liveness failure",
      "explanation": "You'll see RESTARTS count increment and pod briefly show NotReady. Liveness failure triggers container restart (not pod deletion). Press Ctrl+C after seeing restart.",

      "command": "kubectl get pods -n scenarios -l app=probes-demo",
      "description": "Verify RESTARTS column increased",
      "explanation": "RESTARTS column shows how many times containers have been restarted. Should be 1 or more after liveness failure. This proves liveness probe auto-recovery.",
      "what_it_does": "Displays pod restart counts.",
      "next_step": "Test readiness probe separately."

      "description": "View service endpoint list",
      "explanation": "Shows which pod IPs are included in the service. Only Ready pods are listed. If a pod fails readiness, it's removed from here (but pod stays running).",
