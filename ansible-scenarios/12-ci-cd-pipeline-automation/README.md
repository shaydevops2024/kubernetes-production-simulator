# CI/CD Pipeline Automation with Ansible

## Overview
Integrate Ansible into a complete CI/CD pipeline. Learn to deploy applications from Git repositories, run automated tests, implement blue/green deployment patterns, and perform automatic rollbacks on test failures.

## What You'll Learn
- Integrating Ansible with Jenkins/CI systems
- Deploying applications from Git repositories
- Running automated tests post-deployment
- Implementing blue/green deployment pattern
- Automated rollback on test failures
- Pipeline-as-code with Ansible
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Health checks and smoke tests

## Prerequisites
- Ansible installed locally
- Docker installed (for application containers)
- Git installed and configured
- Understanding of CI/CD concepts
- Basic knowledge of blue/green deployments

## Resources Created
- Docker containers for blue and green environments
- Load balancer with traffic switching capability
- Git-based application deployment
- Automated test suite
- Rollback mechanisms
- Jenkins pipeline integration example

## Cleanup
Run the cleanup commands to stop and remove all Docker containers and deployment artifacts created in this scenario.
