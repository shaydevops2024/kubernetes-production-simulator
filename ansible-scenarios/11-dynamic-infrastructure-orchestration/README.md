# Dynamic Infrastructure Orchestration with Ansible

## Overview
Master advanced Ansible features for dynamic infrastructure management. Learn dynamic inventory from Docker API, conditional execution, task output registration, complex error handling with blocks, and asynchronous task execution.

## What You'll Learn
- Dynamic inventory from Docker API
- Conditional task execution based on gathered facts
- Registering and using task outputs in subsequent tasks
- Complex error handling with blocks, rescue, and always sections
- Asynchronous tasks and polling
- Creating and destroying infrastructure dynamically
- Advanced orchestration patterns
- Ansible Python API usage

## Prerequisites
- Ansible installed locally
- Docker installed and Docker API accessible
- Python docker library (pip install docker)
- Understanding of Ansible fundamentals
- Familiarity with JSON/YAML and APIs

## Resources Created
- Dynamically created Docker containers
- Dynamic inventory scripts
- Complex playbooks with error handling
- Asynchronous task examples
- Infrastructure lifecycle automation

## Cleanup
Run the cleanup commands to stop and remove all dynamically created Docker containers.
