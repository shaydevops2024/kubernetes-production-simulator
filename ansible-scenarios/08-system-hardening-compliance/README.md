# System Hardening and Security Compliance

## Overview
Learn to secure Linux systems using Ansible by applying security hardening configurations. Implement SSH hardening, firewall rules, service management, and intrusion detection to meet security compliance standards.

## What You'll Learn
- SSH security hardening (disable root login, key-only authentication)
- Firewall configuration with UFW
- Disabling unnecessary services
- File permissions and ownership management
- Installing and configuring fail2ban
- Security baseline automation
- Compliance validation

## Prerequisites
- Ansible installed locally
- Docker installed (for target systems)
- Understanding of Linux security concepts
- Basic knowledge of SSH and firewall principles

## Resources Created
- Docker containers simulating production servers
- Hardened SSH configurations
- UFW firewall rules
- fail2ban intrusion detection setup
- Security audit reports
- Compliance validation scripts

## Cleanup
Run the cleanup commands to stop and remove all Docker containers created in this scenario.
