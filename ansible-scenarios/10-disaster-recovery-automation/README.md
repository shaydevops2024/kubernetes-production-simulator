# Disaster Recovery Automation with Ansible

## Overview
Implement automated disaster recovery procedures using Ansible. Learn to automate database backups, configuration backups to Git, restore procedures, and test backup/restore cycles to ensure business continuity.

## What You'll Learn
- Automated PostgreSQL database backups using pg_dump
- Configuration file backups to Git repositories
- Implementing restore procedures with validation
- Testing backup integrity with restore cycles
- Point-in-time recovery simulation
- Backup rotation and retention policies
- Disaster recovery runbooks

## Prerequisites
- Ansible installed locally
- Docker installed (for database containers)
- Git installed and configured
- Understanding of PostgreSQL administration
- Basic knowledge of backup strategies

## Resources Created
- Docker container running PostgreSQL
- Automated backup scripts
- Git repository for configuration backups
- Restore playbooks and procedures
- Backup validation tests
- Recovery point objectives (RPO) demonstration

## Cleanup
Run the cleanup commands to stop and remove Docker containers, remove backup files, and clean up Git repositories created in this scenario.
