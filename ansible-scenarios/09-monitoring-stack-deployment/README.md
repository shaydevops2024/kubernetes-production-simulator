# Monitoring Stack Deployment with Ansible

## Overview
Deploy a complete monitoring stack using Ansible. Set up Prometheus for metrics collection, Node Exporter for system metrics, Grafana for visualization, and configure alerting rules for proactive monitoring.

## What You'll Learn
- Deploying Prometheus monitoring server
- Configuring Prometheus scrape targets and service discovery
- Installing Node Exporter for system metrics
- Setting up Grafana with datasources and dashboards
- Creating Prometheus alerting rules
- Container-based monitoring architecture
- Monitoring best practices and patterns

## Prerequisites
- Ansible installed locally
- Docker installed (for monitoring components)
- Understanding of metrics and monitoring concepts
- Basic knowledge of HTTP and time-series data

## Resources Created
- Docker containers running Prometheus, Node Exporter, and Grafana
- Prometheus scrape configurations
- Alert rules for system monitoring
- Grafana dashboards and datasources
- Service discovery configurations

## Cleanup
Run the cleanup commands to stop and remove all Docker containers and monitoring data created in this scenario.
