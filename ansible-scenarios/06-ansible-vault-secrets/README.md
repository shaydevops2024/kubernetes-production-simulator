# Ansible Vault - Secrets Management

## Overview
Learn to securely manage sensitive data using Ansible Vault. Encrypt secrets, use multiple vault IDs for different environments, and deploy encrypted credentials to applications running in Docker containers.

## What You'll Learn
- Encrypting and decrypting files with ansible-vault
- Using vault-encrypted variables in playbooks
- Managing multiple vault IDs for different environments
- Rotating encrypted credentials
- Deploying secrets to containerized applications
- Best practices for secrets management

## Prerequisites
- Ansible installed locally
- Docker installed (for target hosts)
- Understanding of Ansible variables and playbooks
- Basic knowledge of environment separation (dev/staging/prod)

## Resources Created
- Docker containers running web applications
- Encrypted vault files for different environments
- Playbooks demonstrating secure credential deployment
- Configuration files with encrypted passwords

## Cleanup
Run the cleanup commands to stop and remove all Docker containers and remove encrypted vault files created in this scenario.
