# Variables, Locals, and Outputs
Master Terraform's data flow with input variables, local values for DRY configuration, and outputs for cross-module sharing.

## Learning Objectives
- Define input variables with types, defaults, descriptions, and validation rules
- Use locals to compute values and eliminate repetition
- Create outputs to expose values for other modules and automation
- Understand terraform.tfvars files and variable precedence

## Prerequisites
- Completed Scenario 01 (Provider Setup and First Resource)
- Understanding of HCL syntax basics

## Resources Created
- Variable declarations with multiple types (string, number, list, map, object)
- Locals block for computed values and naming conventions
- Output definitions for resource attributes
- terraform.tfvars file for environment-specific values

## Cleanup
The final step removes all displayed configuration files and resets the scenario environment.
