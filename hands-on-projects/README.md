# Hands-On DevOps Projects

Real-world, production-grade projects you build from scratch — learning DevOps by doing, not just reading.

Each project includes a pre-built application so you can focus **100% on DevOps tasks**: containerization, orchestration, service mesh, CI/CD, observability, security, and more.

---

## How Each Project is Structured

Every project has three folders:

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `app/` | The application source code — services, Dockerfiles, and app-level README. You don't write this, but you containerize and deploy it. |
| `local/` | Docker Compose setup to run the full stack locally. Your first DevOps task. |
| `main/` | Production-ready deployment — Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, service mesh config, CI/CD pipelines. This is what you build toward. |

**Workflow:** `app/` → understand → `local/` → run locally → `main/` → deploy to production

## Prerequisites

Before starting any project:
- Docker & Docker Compose installed
- `kubectl` installed and configured
- A Kubernetes cluster (Kind, Minikube, or cloud)
- Basic understanding of containers and Linux

## Learning Path

**Beginner:** Start with Project 01 (local/ folder only) → Project 02 → Project 07

**Intermediate:** Projects 01–03 (full main/ deployment) → Project 04 (observability) → Project 05

**Advanced:** Projects 07, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16
